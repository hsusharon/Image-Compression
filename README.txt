The objection of this project is to compress the given image(image.bmp) by implementing JPEG compression techniques from scratch.
Run main.c and keep the input data(image) in the same directory as main.c

The knowledge require to understand the code is listed below:
YIQ, DFT, DPCM, Zigzag, Huffman encoding(decoding)

The code required multiple steps, so to make sure every set works perfectly, there is also another function of the inverse of every function.

Make sure your computer has sufficient memory to run this code.
