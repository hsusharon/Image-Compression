The objection of this project is to compress the given image which has a compression rate of 40%.
Run main.c and keep the input data(image) in the same directory as main.c

The knowledge require to understand the code is listed below:
YIQ, DFT, DPCM, Zigzag, Huffman encoding(decoding)

The code required multiple steps, so to make sure every set works perfectly, there is also another function of the inverse of every function.
